# automated-red-team-platform
Web platform to plan, track, and report multi-step red team attack campaigns.
## Overview
This project proposes building a web-based platform dedicated to red team operations. Its goal is to help offensive security professionals plan, execute, document, and report multi-step attack campaigns in a structured and professional way.
## Problem Statement
Red team engagements generate a large amount of heterogeneous data including screenshots, logs, command history, emails, chats, tool outputs, payloads, etc.
Making this data into a coherent report for technical staff (e.g., defenders or blue team) and executives (decision-makers) is challenging because the former often want a detailed report to fix gaps and security breaches while the latter focus more on the business impact and the risk to make proper decisions. Therefore reports tend to be very long and contain significant noise.
Simulating an attack can take many weeks and involves many techniques, people, and attack paths that could change when the opportunity allows it. As a result, keeping track of what happened without effective and professional note taking is challenging.
## Project Goals
This project helps red teamers plan, execute, document, and report a multi-step attack. They can also keep track of the attack while adding and updating steps and paths taken. The system then generates an effective and professional report with the output generated by the attack.
## Scope
The primary users of the platform are red team professionals. The system is designed to help them solve the recurring problem of reporting and tracking attacker activity.
## Tech Stack (Planned)
- Backend: Python with FastAPI
Handles engagement management, attack steps tracking, evidence collection, and report generation logic.
- Frontend: Server-side rendered HTML using Jinja2 templates
The frontend is intentionally kept minimal to focus on backend functionality and red team workflows.
- Database: SQLite (development), PostgreSQL (planned for later stages)
Used to store engagements, scenarios, attack steps, evidence metadata, and findings.
- File Storage: Local filesystem
Stores collected artifacts such as screenshots, logs, command outputs, and payloads.
- Report Generation: HTML templates rendered to PDF
Used to automatically generate structured red team reports from the collected data.
-Authentication (Planned): Token-based authentication
Provides basic access control for platform users.
## Project Status
This project is currently under active development.

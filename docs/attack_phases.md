## Reconnaissance  
Consists of techniques that adversary use to gather information about the target. Such information may include details about the victim organization, infrastructure, or staff/personnel.
## Resources Development  
Consists of techniques that involve adversaries creating, purchasing, or compromising/stealing resources that can be used to support targeting. Such resources include infrastructure, accounts, or capabilities.
## Initial Access  
Initial Access consists of techniques that use various entry vectors to gain their initial foothold within a network. Techniques used to gain a foothold include targeted spearphishing and exploiting weaknesses on public-facing web servers.
## Execution  
Execution consists of techniques that result in adversary-controlled code running on a local or remote system. Techniques that run malicious code are often paired with techniques from all other tactics to achieve broader goals, like exploring a network or stealing data.
## Persistence  
Persistence consists of techniques that adversaries use to keep access to systems across restarts, changed credentials, and other interruptions that could cut off their access.
## Privilege Escalation  
Privilege Escalation consists of techniques that adversaries use to gain higher-level permissions on a system or network. Adversaries can often enter and explore a network with unprivileged access but require elevated permissions to follow through on their objectives.
## Defense Evasion 
Defense Evasion consists of techniques that adversaries use to avoid detection throughout their compromise. Techniques used for defense evasion include uninstalling/disabling security software or obfuscating/encrypting data and scripts. 
## Lateral Movement  
Lateral Movement consists of techniques that adversaries use to enter and control remote systems on a network. Following through on their primary objective often requires exploring the network to find their target, then pivoting through multiple systems and accounts to gain access to it.
## Collection 
Collection consists of techniques adversaries use to gather information and the sources information is collected from that are relevant to following through on the adversary's objectives.
## Exfiltration  
Exfiltration consists of techniques that adversaries use to steal data from your network. Once they’ve collected data, adversaries often package it to avoid detection while removing it. 
## Impact  
Impact consists of techniques that adversaries use to disrupt availability or compromise integrity by manipulating business and operational processes. Techniques used for impact can include destroying or tampering with data.

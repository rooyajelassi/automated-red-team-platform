## Problem
Red team engagements generate a large amount of heterogeneous data including screenshots, logs, command history, emails, chats, tools outputs, payloads, etc.
Making this data into a coherent report for technical staff (e.g., defenders or blue team) and executives (decision-makers) is challenging because the former often want a detailed report to fix gaps and security breaches while the latter focus more on the business impact and the risk to make proper decisions. Therefore reports tend to be very long and contain significant noise.  
Simulating an attack can take many weeks and involves many techniques, people, and attack paths that could change when the opportunity allows it. As a result, keeping track of what happened without effective and professional note taking is challenging.
## Goal
This project helps red teamers plan, execute, document and report a multi-step attack. They can also keep track of the attack while adding and updating steps and paths taken. The system  then generates an effective and professional report with the output generated by the attack.
## Target users 
The primary users of the platform are red team professionals. The system is designed to help them solve the recurring problem of reporting and tracking attacker activity.
